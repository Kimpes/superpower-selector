    longDescription:
      "Haven't we all dreamt of flying through the skies like an eagle, swim through the oceans like a dolphin, or eat shit like a fly? With this power, you will be able to transform into any animal that currently isn't extinct. You will keep your human intelligence and be able to switch back to a human at any time. The power can only be used for one hour every day, though, so make sure to keep track of the time when flying high in the air, lest you want to fall to your death.",

    longDescription:
      "We've all fantasized about having someone who could do our biddings, but we've either not been able to get one, or we have felt bad about the moral implications. Both those problems are solved with Ed'har. He is technically a demon, but he doesn't possess any magical powers; He just looks like a really pale tall old dude. He has no emotions and feels no pain, and he will do whatever you ask of him. If you ever feel bad about what you're making him do, just remember that he's a demon, and has no soul.",
